<h2>About the Conference</h2>
<div>In the era of modern communication and Internet systems, people rely on the Internet for their
day-to-day life activities in office, educational institute, business, marketing and others.
Moreover, we know that data generated from our daily life activity is also playing a major role
in our lifestyle. Every day we generate a huge amount of data which may be our personal data
or organizational data. The size of data is tremendously increasing with the increase size of
network or Internet, increased number of users in the Internet or due to the wide application
areas of modern Internet. In addition, the Gov. of India initiated the Digital India movement
and under the umbrella of Digital India many profit and non-profit organizations started reallife projects in various areas such as Agriculture, Healthcare, Transportation, Smart Cities,
Power Grid and many others. The fundamental technologies used in most of the applications
areas are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning, Internet-of-Things,
Blockchain, AI and Software Defined Networking.</div><br><div>
The main purpose of the conference entitled “Machine Learning in IoT” is to familiar the stateof-the-art techniques used in Machine Learning (ML) for data analysis and future prediction.
The application of ML is very common in the Internet of Things (IoT) network. As IoT network
connects billions of smart objects known as Things to the Internet and communication among
themselves or to the global network during data sharing, so it generates a huge amount of data
in every second. The major concern here is data privacy and security, and also the IoT network
security. The ML learning not only plays major role in decision making, future prediction and
real-time recommendation but it can also enhance privacy and security to the IoT network.
Therefore, we should have a depth knowledge on ML techniques that are quite useful for IoT
data analysis, data privacy, and security.</div><br><hr/>
